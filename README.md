# Fire Detection Using AI
This project aims to develop a fire detection system utilizing deep learning algorithms. The system leverages the YOLOv8 object detection model, trained with custom datasets, to detect fire in real-time.

Technologies Used:
Python: Core programming language for model implementation.
Google Colab: Used for training and experimenting with the YOLOv8 model in a cloud-based environment.
YOLOv8: A state-of-the-art object detection algorithm for identifying fire in images or videos.
Roboflow: Platform used for dataset preparation, including labeling and augmentation.
